-Before Coding-

* Deciding on using React js instead of Vue js, because I never used Vue js.

* Drawing the page given on a piece of paper to devide components.

* Figuring out the aproximate sizes of components.


-During Coding-

* Added border-box to the whole page, to help me size components much easier.

* Used flex box, for compatibility reasons although I usually use Grid. http://flexbox.help/ this website   helped a lot.

* Instaled a slider: "React Slick".

* Created reusable components (the cards in How it Works).
