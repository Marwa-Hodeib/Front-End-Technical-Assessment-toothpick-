First step was deciding weather to create the app using something I never used which is Vue js or to create it using something I am familiar with, that's why I chose React js. 


Next step was drawing the page given on a piece of paper to devide the components.

Then decided to create the page on a mobile phone first, which is the smallest when it comes to responsivness, because when loading the page on a PC it's easier to load the mobile interface than vise versa. had to remember how to start with that so I watched a small tutorial on YouTube.

Used flex box, although I usually like to use grid, for compatibility reasons.
