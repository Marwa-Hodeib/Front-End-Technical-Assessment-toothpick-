-Before Coding-

* Deciding on using React js instead of Vue js, because I never used Vue js

* Drawing the page given on a piece of paper to devide components.

* Figuring out the aproximate sizes of components.


-During Coding-

* Used flex box, for compatibility reasons although I usually use Grid. http://flexbox.help/ this website helped a lot.

* Instaled a slider "React Slick".
